# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.

# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

*.rbc
capybara-*.html
.rspec
/public/system
/coverage/
*.orig
rerun.txt
pickle-email-*.html

# config/secrets.yml

# dotenv
# TODO Comment out this rule if environment variables can be committed
.env

# Ignore bundler config.

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/tmp/*
